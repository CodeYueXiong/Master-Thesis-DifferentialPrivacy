### The synthetic data is generated 

- Task 1: plot the distribution of the original data and the synthetic data for general comparison.

With one-way utility measure, we try to plot the compare histogram plots included in package *synthpop* to have a general overview of the synthetic dataset and the original dataset. With too many variables involved in both datasets, we also manage to subset 5 of the variables from the original columns and show you the comparison analysis done by the __compare__ function. To be more specific, the 5 variables are selected randomly, i.e., B3 and B1_1 from the "symptoms" group, 


- Task 2: evaluate the propensity mean squared error from the synthetic data to the original data (hint: use the utility.gen function implemented)
